### Run this script to start the cron job:
```
./cron_setup.sh
```

### Run this script to stop the cron job:
```
./remove_cron.sh
```

**Note: ** The cron job is set to run after every 24 hours to avoid abusing the source and end up getting banned, but can be changed by editing the INTERVAL_HOURS variable in the *cron_setup.sh* file
